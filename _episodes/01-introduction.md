### Overview:
Visualizing information is one of the most powerful ways to understand data. Humans, it has been said, are visual creatures. For example, 82 percent of engineering students reported a preference for [visual learning](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Understanding_Differences.pdf). Yet the tools employed by geospatialists [this term needs to be changed later] often, have not kept up with the pace of data aquisition. However, new tools have emerged that help cope with this torrent of data.
