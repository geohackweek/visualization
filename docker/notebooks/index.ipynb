    "### Instructions to launch the notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static view\n",
    "\n",
    "If you reached this page from the [Geohackweek schedule](http://geohackweek.github.io/) then clicking on one of the notebooks below will take you to a static version rendered by Github.  You can view the notebook and most of the output but it will not be interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run on your laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run the notebooks, then you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/geohackweek/visualization.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "start a Jupyter notebook server, and then navigate to the folder `visualization/docker/notebooks` and open the notebook `index.ipynb` to see an interactive version of this notebook.  Then clicking on a notebook name below should open the notebook.  They should run with either Python 2 or Python 3 provided you have all the required dependencies installed. If you don't, some of the `import` statements will give an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run with docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already pulled the latest version from dockerhub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    docker pull geohackweek2016/vistutorial\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then follow the [docker tutorial instructions](https://geohackweek.github.io/Introductory/01-docker-tutorial/)  section titled \"Docker Containers Work with Jupyter Notebooks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run on SageMathCloud\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Geohackweek2016 project on [SMC](https://cloud.sagemath.com) then you can open the project, start a terminal, clone the repository (as described above), and navigate to the `visualization/docker/notebooks` directory and launch `index.ipynb`.  For the notebooks to run properly, you need to run them with the \"Anaconda (Python 3)\" kernel, which can be selected from the \"Kernel\" -> \"Change kernel\" tab once the notebook is open.\n",
